A car file is the recommended and easier deployment of the deployable artifacts of WSO2 products. A car file can contain many deployable artifacts together for a single work flow or many work flows, and in one single click, the all the artifacts get deployed in a relavent order getting rid of the users headache on the deployement. The SampleCApp0115.car is created using sample 0115 (../artifacts/0115/) and the manual deployment of that sample can be automated using this one single file.

Follow the below steps for the deployement.

1. Unzip and start a CEP Product (4.0.0 or later).
2. Goto management console.
3. Main -> Carbon Applications -> Add .
4. Upload the SampleCApp0115.car.
5. Wait for few seconds and use the deployables deployed.
6. If the cApp is available in the cApp list, go and check the artifacts are also available in their lists.
